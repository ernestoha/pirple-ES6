# RequireJS.



### What is RequireJS:
It is a JavaScript library to organize JavaScript modules and calls. The result is a code split in small pieces with better quality that runs faster. Can be used in-browser, or in environments like NodeJs.

### How It Works:
Download requireJS, add to the project to manage the modules.



### Why I Like It:
RequireJS is a light library that allows me to keep JavaScript modules organized and it is compatible with modern browers.


### Use-Case:
When the project has a lot of dependencies, RequireJS helps to keep organized and clean the code.
